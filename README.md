# 3GC3-Terrain-Generator

Renders a 500x500 pixel random terrain map using the circles or fault algorithm described here (http://www.lighthouse3d.com/opengl/terrain/index.php)
to displace points upwards, with lighting from two lighting sources at either side of the terrain.
Terrain is shaded based on its height. 
Lighting, wireframe vs. solid rendering, triangle vs. quad rendering, and circle vs. fault algorithm terrain generation is toggleable.
Includes a second window which displays a heightmap of the terrain and allows editing.
Commands for toggling features printed to the shell.
